KKaKKo Operation:

From travelers perspective:

I go to KkakKo(dot)com & click on Traveler
The Traveler page opens up. 
A simple (screen size, no scrolling) page with a header, a body and a footer
In the header I have the mini logo on the left and a signup/signin form on the right
In the footer we have the privacy, the contract, the faq, the terms and our signature 
In the body I have 2 inputs slots, "From", "To" and an "Enter" button
I fill them (choosing from the cities in our DB, instant search)
The phrase "From Toronto to Tokyo" get printed in the body, above the new input slot, "date"
I choose the date with our calendar selector
a new phrase specifying the date get printed above the new input slot "Airline" and under the previous phrase
I fill it (choosing from the airlines in our DB, instant search)
a new phrase specifying the airline printed above the new input slot "class" and under the previous ones
I choose from the classes (Economy, Business...) our DB know from this specific airline
a new phrase specifying the class get printed under the previous ones
and under that text, images appear, images that show the allowances our DB know that airline gives to this class of passenger for that kind of trip, with an invitation to click on the one I want to sell to KkakKo.
I click on all the allowances I want to sell and press Enter
Our algorithm computes(using parameters as yield management, demand & supply ...) the offer it will give me to purchase my allowances.
Then Its show me a text summarizing my trip, the allowances I want to sell and the price (price per item) KkakKo is willing to buy them right now.  With 2 radio buttons after the text to click, one to accept the contract and the other to accept the terms and conditions. And a big button to sell it.
If i check the radio buttons and press the button, I'm invited to sign in if i already have an account or to sign up otherwise.
Once done, I'm redirected to a kind of check out page where I need to give proof of having already purchased my ticket. 
After that I'm redirected to a confirmation page where my trip is summarized and I'm told where and when is the appointment to pick up the luggage. An email is also sent to me.
After I've accepted the prices before the signin invitation, There are two option to choose I can choose
Add passenger & Add Trip
If I choose Add passenger, I'l just have to choose the class and the allowances I want to sell for that passenger. In my account, I could link that passenger to a list of passengers already there or create a new one. And I'll also be asked his flight ticket.
Note that all passengers, myself including should send us their passport

If I choose the Add Trip option, I'll check a radio button to confirm the same cities, the same flights and classes, otherwise the process will restart. But this time The informations of the previous trips will be on the right

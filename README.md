KKaKKo Operation:

From travelers perspective:

I go to KkakKo.com & click on Traveler
The Traveler page opens up. 
A simple (screen size, no scrolling) page with a header, a body and a footer
In the header I have the mini logo on the left and a signup/signin form on the right
In the footer we have the privacy, the contract, the faq, the terms and our signature 
In the body I have 2 inputs slots, "From", "To" and an "Enter" button
I fill them (choosing from the cities in our DB, instant search)
The phrase "From Toronto to Tokyo" get printed in the body, above the new input slot, "date"
I choose the date with our calendar selector
a new phrase specifying the date get printed above the new input slot "Airline" and under the previous phrase
I fill it (choosing from the airlines in our DB, instant search)
a new phrase specifying the airline printed above the new input slot "class" and under the previous ones
I choose from the classes (Economy, Business...) our DB know from this specific airline
a new phrase specifying the class get printed under the previous ones
and under that text, images appear, images that show the allowances our DB know that airline gives to this class of passenger for that kind of trip, with an invitation to click on the one I want to sell to KkakKo.
I click on all the allowances I want to sell and press Enter
Our algorithm computes(using parameters as yield management, demand & supply ...) the offer it will give me to purchase my allowances.
Then Its show me a text summarizing my trip, the allowances I want to sell and the price (price per item) KkakKo is willing to buy them right now.  With 2 radio buttons after the text to click, one to accept the contract and the other to accept the terms and conditions. And a big button to sell it.
If i check the radio buttons and press the button, I'm invited to sign in if i already have an account or to sign up otherwise.
Once done, I'm redirected to a kind of check out page where I need to give proof of having already purchased my ticket. 
After that I'm redirected to a confirmation page where my trip is summarized and I'm told where and when is the appointment to pick up the luggage. An email is also sent to me.
After I've accepted the prices before the signin invitation, There are two option to choose I can choose
Add passenger & Add Trip
If I choose Add passenger, I'l just have to choose the class and the allowances I want to sell for that passenger. In my account, I could link that passenger to a list of passengers already there or create a new one. And I'll also be asked his flight ticket.
Note that all passengers, myself including should send us their passport

If I choose the Add Trip option, I'll check a radio button to confirm the same cities, the same flights and classes, otherwise the process will restart. But this time The informations of the previous trips will be on the right

From Senders perspective:

I go to KkakKo.com
On the main page I can just start the process to send
The page is also pretty simple (Screen fit, no scroll) 
Header - Body - Footer
Header contains, logo on the left and on the right, Traveler and signup/signin form
The footer contains a lot of things, one row for about us, The team, The Journey, Faq ... things about the company, Another row contains the legals, terms & conditions, privacy,...; Another one contains our contacts, Twitter, Number(It will change by country), Chat ... and under all them rows, our signature (Made with love by african minds in Cameroon, France & USA)
The body contains 2 big radio buttons "courriers" & "Parcels" and 2 Input slots "From" & "To"
I check the parcel radio button and it disappears to give place to a big "h1" with the label of the radio button chosen as to remind me all time that I'm sending a courrier or a parcel.
I fill the inputs (choosing from the cities in our DB, instantsearch)
the phrase "From Bana to Bangou" get printed under "Parcel" and above 2 new input slots
One to select the size and the other one to select the Weight, with the mention "under" before the slots
I choose the size and the weight
a new phrase summarizing it get printed above a list of radio buttons to check to know if my parcel contains electronics with battery, fragile items, items irreplaceable, ....
I check the buttons that apply to my parcel
a new phrase summarizing it get printed above a new input slot "Value" 
I enter the total value of my parcel
a new phrase summarizing it get printed above new buttons (our DB will show the options if available for the route chosen) and under the previous ones
I have the "Standard" option the "Fast" option, the "Overnight" option and the "SuperFast" option
Under each option, I have the time necessary for the delivery and the price (our algorithm computes it with the data above) I'll pay.
I choose my option and a text is produced to summarize my basket and after each phrase (choice) there's an edit button where I can modify it (the size, the weight, the options). 
Under the text there are two radio buttons, one for the contract (responsibility & things allowed to be sent) and another for the terms and conditions. There is a big button inviting to proceed.
I click on it and I get redirected to a page where I'm invited to signIn or signup.
Once done, I choose my payment method and I also choose my recipient in my list of recipient (or I add a new one with name, address & contact) and I click next.
After that there's a summary of my basket. I'm also told where I'll leave the parcel and the receiver will pick it.
Then a QR code is sent to me via email (I can also directly print it out from here), with the instructions to follow.
I'll follow the instructions and go to the spot specified with the package and the QR code.
The KkakKo agent will take the parcel, scan the QR code and enter it in our DB. A new QR code will be sent to the recipient to collect the parcel alongside his ID.
